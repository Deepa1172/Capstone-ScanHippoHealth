# ScanHippoHealth üß†üíä

![ScanHippoHealth Logo](screenshots/logo.png)

ScanHippoHealth is a sophisticated MRI segmentation project specifically designed for the segmentation of the Hippocampus. The project utilizes the dataset provided by the [Medical Segmentation Decathlon](http://medicaldecathlon.com/) for Generalizable 3D Semantic Segmentation.

## Overview

The project employs a 3D-Unet architecture for accurate segmentation. The architecture diagram can be found at `screenshots/Segmentation Architecture.png`.

## Features üöÄ

- **User Authentication:** Secure (Input Validations) login, logout, and registration functionalities are integrated.
- **Data Security:** User passwords are hashed and salted using the bcrypt library before storage in the MYSQL database.
- **MRI Segmentation:** Users can upload MRI images in `.nii.gz` format through the user-friendly Flask application.
- **Prediction and Visualization:** The model predicts the MRI images and displays six slices of the input image along with the corresponding mask. This aids in visualizing the segmentation results.
